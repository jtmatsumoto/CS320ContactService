Contact Service Files

How can I ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure?

Through ensuring that the requirements are correctly tested for with JUnit tests, I can defend the quality of the code based on the coverage percentage. For example, the coverage percentage of the JUnit testing performed in the task service project shows us that all tests successfully passed and therefore the requirements are met. I ensured that the code was technically sound by using comments to highlight specific elements of testing such as checking character length and the ability to add, delete, or update contacts. 

How do I interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program?

I interpret user needs by reviewing requirements and ensuring that they coded correctly into each service file. I also write detailed comments before each function to demonstrate the intended purpose. After coding each requirement, I code unbiased JUnit tests to verify that the service files meet all of the requirements or user needs.

How do I approach designing software?

I approach designing software by reviewing client or user information and plan the files that will be required to correct the final project. After reviewing requirements and planning the code, I begin to write each line of code with detailed comments to refer back to. I also check to ensure no errors are presented in the source-code editior Sublime Text. After the service files are completed, I double check the requirements and code the correct JUnit tests to verify that the service files are correct.
